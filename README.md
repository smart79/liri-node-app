# liri-node-app
LIRI Bot is a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data. 
This app uses parameters for movies, songs and bands and makes calls to Spotify, Bands-in-Town API, and OMDB API for search results.

The commands used for search results and desired data are as follows:
'spotify-this-song', 'concert-this', 'movie-this', 'and 'do-what-it-says'.


This app allows the user to search entertainment information on their desired movies, songs, music artists and events.

To get started clone the repository and then you will need to create your own .env file with your personal Spotify ID and Secret in the following syntax format:

____________________________________
# Spotify API keys

SPOTIFY_ID=your-spotify-id
SPOTIFY_SECRET=your-spotify-secret
____________________________________

***NOTE***
-Your personal Spotify ID and Spotify Secret just replaces <your-spotify-id> and <your-spotify-secret> respectively right after the equal sign with no extra spaces.
